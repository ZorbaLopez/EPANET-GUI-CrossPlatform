It is highly recommended that storage tanks and source locations be included in the set of locations where measurements are made.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"color: #010100;\">To simulate future conditions start with arbitrary initial values (except at the tanks) and run the analysis for a number of repeating demand pattern cycles so that the water quality results begin to repeat in a periodic fashion as well. The number of such cycles can be reduced if good initial estimates are made for the water quality in the tanks. For example, if modeling water age the initial value could be set to the tank&#39;s average residence time which is approximately equal to the fraction of its volume it exchanges each day.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
popid_76626302="<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"color: #010100;\">Bulk reaction coefficients can be estimated by performing a bottle test in the laboratory (see <a href=\"bulk_flow_reaction_rates.htm\" class=\"topiclink\">Bulk Flow Reaction Rates<\/a>). Wall reaction rates cannot be measured directly. They must be back-fitted against calibration data collected from field studies (e.g., using trial and error to determine coefficient values that produce simulation results that best match field observations). Plastic pipe and relatively new lined iron pipe are not expected to exert any significant wall demand for disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramines.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"

Select Options - Reactions from the <a href=\"data_browser.htm\" class=\"topiclink\">Data Browser<\/a>. Set the bulk reaction order to 1 and the limiting concentration to the maximum THM level that the water can produce, given a long enough holding time. Set the bulk reaction coefficient to a positive number reflective of the rate of THM production (e.g., 0.7 divided by the THM doubling time). Estimates of the reaction coefficient and the limiting concentration can be obtained from laboratory testing. The reaction coefficient will increase with increasing water temperature. Initial concentrations at all network nodes should at least equal the THM concentration entering the network from its source node.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
