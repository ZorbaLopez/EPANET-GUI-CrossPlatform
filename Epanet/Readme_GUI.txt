This folder archives the Lazarus source code for the EPANET graphical user interface.

This archive contains the Lazarus source code for the Windows, Linux and MacOS 
graphical user interface, EPANET2W, that runs EPANET Version 2.2. EPANET is a 
pipe network analysis program that allows a user to create or import a
pipe network database, compute the hydraulic and water quality behavior
of the network, and selectively view simulation results in a variety of
different formats.

The code has been compiled successfully with the Version 2.2.6 of Lazarus
and Version 3.2.2 Free Pascal Compiler. The executable produced
from this code is named epanet2w,  and in Windows works together with the
following files that are all part of the EPANET 2 distribution package:
epanet2.dll (in the API Engine folder), epanet2.chm, and tutorial.chm 
(both in the Help folder, including the htmlhelp source files). 
Equivalent files for Linux and MacOS are provided.

Due to the cross-platform nature o this project, ready made application
bundles are included in the AppBundle folder for each platform. 

The EPANET2W application is a fairly large one, consisting of 38
forms, 11 Pascal units, and 5 custom components.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Before loading the EPANET2W project into the Lazarus IDE you
      must install the collection of EPANET2W custom components on to
      Lazarus's Component Pallette. These can be found in a separate
      folder named components.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The principal forms used by the application (with the names of their
Pascal units in parentheses) are as follows:

MainForm (Fmain.pas)
--------------------
This is the parent form for the project. It houses the Main Menu and 
Toolbars that control program operation.

MapForm (Fmap.pas)
------------------
This is a frame embedded into the MainForm that displays an editable 
schematic of the pipe network being analyzed. 

BrowserForm (Fbrowser.pas)
--------------------------
An frame embedded into the MainForm used to navigate through the 
pipe network database and control what information is viewed in 
color-coded fashion on the network map.

PropEditForm (Fproped.pas)
--------------------------
A frame embedded into the MainForm that lists and edits the 
properties for the current network component selected on the 
network map or from the Browser. 

OVMapForm (Fovmap.pas)
----------------------
A stay-on-top form that shows the current view extent of the
network map on an outline map of the entire network.

SummaryForm (Fsummary.pas)
--------------------------
A modal dialog form that displays an editable title and notes
for the current network being analyzed, and summarizes the number
of components that comprise the network.

SimulationForm (Fsimul.pas)
---------------------------
A modal dialog form that displays the progress of the computations
for a simulation run.

StatusForm (Fstatus.pas)
------------------------
A form that displays a status report for the most recently completed 
simulation run.

TableForm (Ftable.pas)
----------------------
A form that displays design and computed values for network 
parameters in a tabular view.

GraphForm (Fgraph.pas)
----------------------
A form that displays design and computed values for network 
parameters via X-Y plots.

ContourForm (Fcontour.pas)
--------------------------
A form that displays values of a design or computed parameter 
in the form of a contour plot.

EnergyForm (Fenergy.pas)
------------------------
A form that displays a table of pumping energy utilization.

CalibForm (Fcalib.pas)
----------------------
A form that compares simulated results against a set of measured 
values in tabular and graphical formats.

In addition, there are a collection of dialog forms used to obtain
specialized information from the user. A listing of these forms
identified by their Pascal units follows:

Dabout.pas    About dialog box for the EPANET2W program
Dcalib1.pas   Used to register calibration data files with the
              project being analyzed
Dcalib2.pas   Selects parameter and locations to use for a 
              calibration report
Dcolramp.pas  Selects a map color scheme from a set of choices
Dcontour.pas  Selects contour map display options
Dcontrol.pas  Edits either the Simple Controls or Rule Based Controls
              that define how a pipe network is operated
Dcopy.pas     Selects choice of format and destination for copying
              the current view (map, graph, table, etc.)
Dcurve.pas    Edits the X-Y values for a curve (e.g., pump curve,
              pump efficiency curve, tank volume curve, etc.)
Ddataexp.pas  Selects database scenarios to save to file
Ddefault.pas  Selects default settings for the current project
Ddemand.pas   Edits multiple water demand categories at a specific 
              node of the network
Dfind.pas     Locates a specific node or link on the map by ID label
Dgraph.pas    Selects display and format options for a X-Y graph
Dgrouped.pas  Modifies a design parameter for a group of selected
              objects
Dinperr.pas   Displays a list of error messages generated when 
              importing a network description file
Dlabel.pas    Edit box used to insert a label on the network map
Dlegend.pas   Selects colors and numerical ranges for displaying
              a network parameter on the map
Dmap.pas      Selects map display options
Dmapdim.pas   Specifies the real-world dimensions the network map
Dmapexp.pas   Selects which format the network map should be saved
              to file in
Dpattern.pas  Edits the multipliers that comprise a time pattern
Dprefers.pas  Sets program preferences
Dquery.pas    Defines a condition to display on the network map
              (e.g., find all nodes with pressure below 20 psi)
